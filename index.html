      <li>I just wanted to thank you for my amazing 30th birthday custom cookies! As you know, I’ve been ordering from you for years, but have never had custom cookies for myself! I was so pleasantly surprised when Chris brought my custom cookie favors to my birthday trip/party. They are so ME 🙂 You did an absolutely fantastic job with them. Thank you so very much. I am a lifetime customer!</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the time taken with me to have the perfect Seahawk themed cake. They made sure I was happy before I left and even offered to deck the cake out in blue and green for this 12th man!!! Thank you so much. My 44 birthday will be the best yet!!</li>
